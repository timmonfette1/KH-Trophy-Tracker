Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 Trophy Tracker
===================

`<Insert link to website here>`

A web based tracker for Platinum Trophy RTA Speedruns for Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 for the PS4.  Currently, only Kingdom Hearts 1 Final Mix is supported here, but support for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix trophies is coming soon.<br />

All trophies start in Black and White meaning they haven't been obtained yet.<br />
Hovering your mouse over a trophy will give a tool-tip with the trophy name.<br />
Once you obtain a trophy, you click on it and it will become colored.<br />
This will allow for more clear tracking of trophies instead of using splits that can vary in length from run to run because of RNG.

NOTE
-------
Please note that refreshing the page will RESET ALL TROPHIES TO BLACK AND WHITE.
